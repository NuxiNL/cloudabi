|
| CloudABI is what you get if you take POSIX, add capability-based
| security, and remove everything that's incompatible with that. The
| result is a minimal ABI consisting of only 49 syscalls.
|
| CloudABI doesn't have its own kernel, but instead is implemented in existing
| kernels: FreeBSD has CloudABI support for x86-64 and arm64, and [a patch-set
| for NetBSD](https://github.com/NuxiNL/netbsd) and [a patch-set for
| Linux](https://github.com/NuxiNL/linux) are available as well. This means that
| CloudABI binaries can be executed on different operating systems, without any
| modification.
|
| ## Capability-Based Security
|
| Capability-based security means that processes can only perform
| actions that have no global impact. Processes cannot open files by
| their absolute path, cannot open network connections, and cannot
| observe global system state such as the process table.
|
| The capabilities of a process are fully determined by its set of open
| file descriptors (fds). For example, files can only be opened if the
| process already has a file descriptor to a directory the file is in.
|
| Unlike in POSIX, where processes are normally started with file
| descriptors 0, 1, and 2 reserved for standard input, output, and
| error, CloudABI does not reserve any file descriptor numbers for
| specific purposes.
|
| In CloudABI, a process depends on its parent process to launch it with
| the right set of resources, since the process will not be able to open
| any new resources. For example, a simple static web server would need
| to be started with a file descriptor to a [TCP
| listener](https://github.com/NuxiNL/flower), and a file descriptor to
| the directory for which to serve files. The web server will then be
| unable to do anything other than reading files in that directory, and
| process incoming network connections.
|
| So, unknown CloudABI binaries can safely be executed without the need
| for containers, virtual machines, or other sandboxing technologies.
|
| Watch [Ed Schouten's Talk at
| 32C3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N29vrPoDv8) for more
| information about what capability-based security for UNIX means.
|
| ## Cloudlibc
|
| [Cloudlibc](https://github.com/NuxiNL/cloudlibc) is an implementation
| of the C standard library, without all CloudABI-incompatible
| functions. For example, Cloudlibc does not have `printf`, but does
| have `fprintf`. It does not have `open`, but does have `openat`.
|
| ## CloudABI-Ports
|
| [CloudABI-Ports](https://github.com/NuxiNL/cloudabi-ports) is a
| collection of ports of commonly used libraries and applications to
| CloudABI. It contains software such as `zlib`, `libpng`, `boost`,
| `memcached`, and much more. The software is patched to not depend on
| any global state, such as files in `/etc` or `/dev`, using `open()`,
| etc.
|
| ## Using CloudABI
|
| Instructions for using CloudABI (including kernel modules/patches,
| toolchain, and ports) are available for several operating systems:
|
| - [FreeBSD](https://cloudabi.org/run/freebsd/)
| - [Linux](https://cloudabi.org/run/linux/)
| - [macOS](https://cloudabi.org/run/macos/)
|
| ## Specification of the ABI
|
| The entire ABI is specified in a file called
| [`cloudabi.txt`](https://github.com/NuxiNL/cloudabi/blob/master/cloudabi.txt),
| from which all
| [headers](https://github.com/NuxiNL/cloudabi/tree/master/headers)
| and documentation (including the one you're reading now) is generated.

enum uint8 advice
	| File or memory access pattern advisory information.
	1 dontneed
		| The application expects that it will not access the
		| specified data in the near future.
	2 noreuse
		| The application expects to access the specified data
		| once and then not reuse it thereafter.
	3 normal
		| The application has no advice to give on its behavior
		| with respect to the specified data.
	4 random
		| The application expects to access the specified data
		| in a random order.
	5 sequential
		| The application expects to access the specified data
		| sequentially from lower offsets to higher offsets.
	6 willneed
		| The application expects to access the specified data
		| in the near future.

enum uint32 auxtype
	| Enumeration describing the kind of value stored in [auxv].
	@cprefix AT_
	256 argdata
		| Base address of the binary argument data provided to
		| [proc_exec].
	257 argdatalen
		| Length of the binary argument data provided to
		| [proc_exec].
	7 base
		| Base address at which the executable is placed in
		| memory.
	258 canary
		| Base address of a buffer of random data that may be
		| used for non-cryptographic purposes, for example as a
		| canary for stack smashing protection.
	259 canarylen
		| Length of a buffer of random data that may be used
		| for non-cryptographic purposes, for example as a
		| canary for stack smashing protection.
	260 ncpus
		| Number of CPUs that the system this process is running
		| on has.
	0   null
		| Terminator of the auxiliary vector.
	6   pagesz
		| Smallest memory object size for which individual
		| memory protection controls can be configured.
	3   phdr
		| Address of the first ELF program header of the
		| executable.
	4   phnum
		| Number of ELF program headers of the executable.
	263 pid
		| Identifier of the process.
		|
		| This environment does not provide any simple numerical
		| process identifiers, for the reason that these are not
		| useful in distributed contexts. Instead, processes are
		| identified by a UUID.
		|
		| This record should point to sixteen bytes of binary
		| data, containing a version 4 UUID (fully random).
	262 sysinfo_ehdr
		| Address of the ELF header of the vDSO.
		|
		| The vDSO is a shared library that is mapped in the
		| address space of the process. It provides entry points
		| for every system call supported by the environment,
		| all having a corresponding symbol that is prefixed
		| with `cloudabi_sys_`. System calls should be invoked
		| through these entry points.
		|
		| The first advantage of letting processes call into a
		| vDSO to perform system calls instead of raising
		| hardware traps is that it allows for easy emulation of
		| executables on top of existing operating systems. The
		| second advantage is that in cases where an operating
		| system provides native support for CloudABI executables,
		| it may still implement partial userspace
		| implementations of these system calls to improve
		| performance (e.g., [clock_time_get]). It also provides
		| a more dynamic way of adding, removing or replacing
		| system calls.
	261 tid
		| Thread ID of the initial thread of the process.

enum uint32 clockid
	| Identifiers for clocks.
	@cprefix CLOCK_

		| clock measuring real time, whose value cannot be
		| adjusted and which cannot have negative clock jumps.
		|
		| The epoch of this clock is undefined. The absolute
		| time value of this clock therefore has no meaning.
	2 process_cputime_id
		| The CPU-time clock associated with the current
		| process.
	3 realtime
		| The system-wide clock measuring real time. Time value
		| zero corresponds with 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
	4 thread_cputime_id
		| The CPU-time clock associated with the current thread.

opaque uint32 condvar
	| A userspace condition variable.
	0 has_no_waiters
		| The condition variable is in its initial state. There
		| are no threads waiting to be woken up. If the
		| condition variable has any other value, the kernel
		| must be called to wake up any sleeping threads.

	| Identifier for a device containing a file system. Can be used
	| in combination with [inode] to uniquely identify a file on the
	| local system.

opaque uint64 dircookie
	| A reference to the offset of a directory entry.
	0 start
		| Permanent reference to the first directory entry
		| within a directory.

	| provided by this environment, but are either used in userspace
	| exclusively or merely provided for alignment with POSIX.

	0x80000000 kernel_managed
		| Bitmask indicating that the lock is either read locked
		| or write locked, and that one or more threads have
		| their execution suspended, waiting to acquire the
		| lock. The last owner of the lock must call the
		| kernel to unlock.
		|
		| When the lock is acquired for reading and this bit is
		| set, it means that one or more threads are attempting
		| to acquire this lock for writing. In that case, other

	0x08 shared
		| The object is stored in shared memory.

	| mapped for execution while also mapped for writing.
	@cprefix PROT_
	0x01 exec
		| Page can be executed.
	0x02 write
		| Page can be written.

	| the CPU's registers to point to that area instead. However, it
	| does need to make sure that the TCB is copied over to the new
	| TLS area.
	|
	| The purpose of the TCB is that it allows light-weight
	| emulators to store information related to individual threads.
	| For example, it may be used to store a copy of the CPU

syscall lock_unlock
	| Unlocks a write-locked userspace lock.
	|
	| If a userspace lock is unlocked while having its
	| [lock.kernel_managed] flag set, the lock cannot be unlocked in
	| userspace directly. This system call needs to be performed
	| instead, so that any waiting threads can be woken up.
	|
	| To prevent spurious invocations of this system call, the lock
	| must be locked for writing. This prevents other threads from
	| acquiring additional read locks while the system call is in
	| progress. If the lock is acquired for reading, it must first
	| be upgraded to a write lock.
	in
		ptr atomic lock lock
			| The userspace lock that is locked for writing
			| by the calling thread.
		scope           scope

			| [fd.map_anon_fd]. Otherwise, this argument
			| specifies the file whose contents need to be
			| mapped.
		filesize   off
			| If [mflags.anon] is set, this argument must be
			| zero. Otherwise, this argument specifies the
			| offset within the file at which the mapping

syscall proc_exec
	| Replaces the process by a new executable.
	|
	| Process execution in CloudABI differs from POSIX in two ways:
	| handling of arguments and inheritance of file descriptors.
	|
	| CloudABI does not use string command line arguments. Instead,
	| a buffer with binary data is copied into the address space of
	| the new executable. The kernel does not enforce any specific
	| structure to this data, although CloudABI's C library uses it
	| to store a tree structure that is semantically identical to
	| YAML.
	|
	| Due to the strong focus on thread safety, file descriptors
	| aren't inherited through close-on-exec flags. An explicit
	| list of file descriptors that need to be retained needs to be
	| provided. After execution, file descriptors are placed in the
	| order in which they are stored in the array. This not only
	| makes the execution process deterministic. It also prevents
	| potential information disclosures about the layout of the
	| original process.
	in
		fd          fd
			| A file descriptor of the new executable.
		crange void data
			| Binary argument data that is passed on to the

syscall proc_fork
	| Forks the process of the calling thread.
	|
	| After forking, a new process shall be created, having only a
	| copy of the calling thread. The parent process will obtain a
	| process descriptor. When closed, the child process is
	| automatically signaled with [signal.kill].
	out
		fd  fd
			| In the parent process: the file descriptor
			| number of the process descriptor.
			|
			| In the child process: [fd.process_child].
		tid tid
			| In the parent process: undefined.
			|
			| In the child process: the thread ID of the
			| initial thread of the child process.

syscall proc_raise
	| Sends a signal to the process of the calling thread.
	in
		signal sig
			| The signal condition that should be triggered.
			| If the signal causes the process to terminate,
			| its condition can be obtained by other
			| processes through
			| [event.proc_terminate.signal].

syscall random_get
	| Obtains random data from the kernel random number generator.
	|
	| As this interface is not guaranteed to be fast, it is advised
	| that the random data obtained through this system call is used
	| as the seed for a userspace pseudo-random number generator.
	in
		range void buf
			| The buffer that needs to be filled with random
			| data.

syscall sock_recv
	| Receives a message on a socket.

			| The desired attributes of the new thread.
	out
		tid tid

	| joining.
	in
		ptr atomic lock lock
			| Userspace lock that is locked for writing by
			| the calling thread.
